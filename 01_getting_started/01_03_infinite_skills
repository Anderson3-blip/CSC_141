 well i have little experience of programming so if i had infite skills 
it would be to have infinite programming skills so that i can be more 
advanced so that i dont struggle, one of my goal for this class is to gain
new skills and learn as much as i can, and if i had infinite skills i
would build a gaming system that is so fast that you would not have to
worry about overheating or crashing
i want to be able to program as soon as i can but i know it takes time
and patience to learn and master this, back in High school i had taken
IT and i thought CS would be easy and the same but i was wrong, its hard
its been challenging because this is different CS is about coding and I am
still not there yet, sometimes i get lost, sometimes i understanding it, and sometimes i dont but I am being patient for the most part, one of my goals is to understanding it and master it by the end of this semester
